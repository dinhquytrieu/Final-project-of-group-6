*My group would like to thank the teachers for creating conditions for us to work on this project. Thanks to the teachers' help throughout the week, along with the advice and guidance of ideas from the previous classmates, we were able to complete the project at this level. That has partly helped us gain more knowledge and experience to prepare for the following years in basic subjects. During the process of working on the project, although we encountered many difficulties in some parts, we together fixed and perfected the program so that the program could run according to the requirements of the project.
Many thanks!
