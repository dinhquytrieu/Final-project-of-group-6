*My group would like to thank the teachers for creating conditions for us to work on this project. That has partly helped us gain more knowledge and experience to prepare for the following years in basic subjects. During the process of working on the project, although we encountered many difficulties in some parts, we together fixed and perfected the program so that the program could run according to the requirements of the project.
Many thanks!
